# Chat-App
Java based Chat Application using Socket Programming
Socket Programming is a concept of computer networks which helps make a connection between a client and a server.
There are two classes in Java namely a Socket class and a ServerSocket class. We create a Server using the "ServerSocket" class and pass a port number. Then we create a Client using the instance of "Server" class and pass the port number and hostname/IP address of the server. 
This basic logic creates a client-server connection.
Now , since our goal is to create a multi-user chat application so we use the concept of "Multithreading in Java".
Hope you like it :)
